This is my new blog. It is a static site generated using my latest project; **Ida**. 
Ida is a static site generator built in javascript. It is in a very early stage right now, but the idea is that it
will continue to improve into something that is usable by other people. I will track my progress here.

For those interested the code is available on [Github](http://github.com/andreasmcdermott/ida).
